# Project Proposal: Fertilizer Impact Prediction

## Objective
To develop a predictive model that forecasts the impact of fertilizers on crop growth using AI and data analytics.

---

## Problem Statement
Farmers face challenges in optimizing fertilizer usage for maximum crop yield. Overuse or underuse of fertilizers can lead to reduced productivity, increased costs, and environmental degradation.

---

## Proposed Solution
A web-based platform that predicts fertilizer impact, suggests optimal fertilizer combinations, and provides cost-efficient recommendations.

---

## Key Features
1. **Predictive Analysis**: AI-based model predicts the effect of fertilizers on crop growth.
2. **User-Friendly Interface**: HTML/Flask interface for easy interaction.
3. **Data-Driven Insights**: Analyze data for smarter farming decisions.
4. **Fertilizer Guidance**: Integrated Gemini API for fertilizer usage descriptions.

---

## Tools and Technologies
- **Programming**: Python, HTML
- **Frameworks**: Flask
- **Machine Learning**: Random Forest Regressor
- **Database**: SQLite
- **APIs**: Gemini API
- **Other**: Cloud storage (for future scalability)

## Deliverables
- Functional web application
- Predictive model with trained dataset
- Fertilizer impact descriptions using Gemini API
- Documentation (README, Proposal, User Guide)

---

## Timeline
1. Week 1-2: Dataset preparation and model training.
2. Week 3: Flask backend setup and database integration.
3. Week 4: Frontend development.
4. Week 5: API integration and testing.
5. Week 6: Deployment and documentation.
