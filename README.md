# Fertilizer Impact and Yield Prediction System

A machine learning-based web application designed to predict the impact of fertilizers on crop yields. This tool provides data-driven insights to help farmers optimize their crop productivity and make informed agricultural decisions.

## Key Features
- **Fertilizer Impact Prediction:** Analyze the effect of different fertilizers on crop yield.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Intuitive and easy-to-navigate design for farmers and researchers.
- **Real-Time Insights:** Instant predictions and suggestions based on input parameters.
- **Data-Driven Decision Making:** Provides actionable insights for agricultural productivity.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3
- **Backend:** Flask (Python)
- **Machine Learning Frameworks:** Scikit-learn, NumPy, Pandas
- **Database:** SQLite
- **Visualization:** Matplotlib

## How It Works
1. Input crop-specific details (e.g., soil type, crop type, fertilizer type, etc.).
2. The system processes the input using a trained machine learning model.
3. Provides a prediction of the fertilizer's impact on crop yield.
4. Displays actionable insights and recommendations to optimize productivity.
